		<p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Elwood Shannon</a> is considered as the father of the information age. He was born on April 30, 1916, he would have been 100 years old this year.
To celebrate Shannon Centenary, a half day event is being organized on May 5, 2016, gathering information theorists, researchers, and students from all backgrounds in Singapore.<br><br></p>

<p>Watch a short video about Shannon made by the IEEE Information Theory Society: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHSRHi17RKM">The Shannon Centennial: 1100100 years of bits</a><br><br></p>

				<h3>Programme - May 5th</h3><br/>
                                 <p><b>Timing: 1:00pm - 6:00pm</b> See our posters and demos, interact with information theorists, watch videos, and listen to some talks. </p><br>

<h4>Talk 1: 2:00pm - 2:45pm <h4> 
<h4><font color="#008000"> <a href="javascript:hideshow(document.getElementById('abs1'))">
Quantum Simplicity - How Complex Systems may be Simplified using Quantum Theory
</a> </font> <br><br> by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.milegu.org/milegu/">Mile GU</a>, NTU/SPMS</h4>

<div id="abs1" style="display:none">
Abstract: We understand complex systems around us though predictive modelling – building algorithms that generate future predictions when given relevant past information. Each model encapsulates a way of understanding future expectations through past observations. In the spirit of Occam’s razor, the better we isolate the causes of what we observe, the greater our understanding. This philosophy privileges the simpler models; should two models make identical predictions, the one that requires less input information is preferred.
<br>
Yet, for almost all stochastic processes, even the provably optimal classical models waste information. The amount of input information they demand exceeds the amount of predictive information they output. This waste creates a significant overhead in memory costs when one seeks to use such models to simulate the world around us – one that becomes increasingly prohibitive as we seek to understand ever more complex systems. In this presentation, will introduce how information can behave differently in the quantum world, and why this allows us to systematically construct quantum models that surpass classical limits.<br>

What we can learn from a bit of information theory
</a> </font> <br><br> by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/motani/"> Mehul MOTANI</a>, NUS/ECE </h4>

<div id="abs2" style="display:none">
Abstract: Information theory is an area of study which sits at the intersection of engineering, applied mathematics, and computer science.  This talk will provide a gentle introduction to information theoretic ideas and connections to diverse areas such as wireless communications, languages, gambling, and life sciences.  Along the way, we will discuss the life and times of Claude Shannon who is considered to be the father of information theory.   Shannon was an engineer from Bell Labs, USA who established the mathematical foundations of the information age, helping to understand the basics of communication, computing, and cryptography.  The talk should be accessible to a fairly wide audience, including undergraduate students, graduate students, and even members of the general public.

A puzzle is worth more than a thousand bits 
</a> </font> <br><br> by <a target="_blank" href="http://www-ee.eng.hawaii.edu/~prasadsn/"> Narayana SANTHANAM</a>, University of Hawaii/EE </h4>

Abstract:
As Hardy once put it, "there is no permanent place in the world for ugly
mathematics". Conversely, there is always a place for fun mathematics
particularly as a tool for explaining the crux of problems. Shannon
was among the best proponents of this line of thinking.  Indeed, the
greatest homage to him is the extent to which simple abstractions
pervade information theory even today. These abstractions, while
elegant and simple to state, are sometimes very hard to solve. But
they always capture something at the core of a physical, practical
problem we want to solve.

We will look at a series of puzzles of varying difficulties that
highlight the research we are working on at the University of Hawaii
today. These puzzles will be self contained, and we will go over
how they dovetail into statistical problems underlying probabilistic
modeling and community detection.

These puzzles are used in the Open Houses we host at University
of Hawaii for a broader audience, not necessarily in engineering. However,
sections of the talk that delve deeper into these puzzles are meant
for students at the upper division undergraduate and graduate level.
